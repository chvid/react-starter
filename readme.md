A reasonable starting point for a frontend application anno 2019:

- React without additional fluff.
- Webpack with relevant loaders including babel for ES6+ and live reloading.
- A folder for static non-embedded images and an index.html that automatically gets scripts and css added.
- Bulma plus font-awesome.
